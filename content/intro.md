# Introduction

Welcome to the **AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook!

This textbook covers the complete stack of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, from foundational concepts to cutting-edge vision-language-action systems.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook is organized into 4 modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn how robots communicate, sense, and coordinate actions through distributed system architecture.

### Module 2: Digital Twin & Simulation
Understand how to create virtual replicas of physical robots and test behaviors safely before deployment.

### Module 3: AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Explore AI-driven robot intelligence, perception, planning, and control using NVIDIA Isaac.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems
Discover how modern AI models combine visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical actions.

## Prerequisites

- No prior robotics experience required
- No programming knowledge required (conceptual focus)
- No software installation needed (concise mode)

## How to Use This Textbook

Each module contains 3 chapters. Each chapter includes:
- **Concept Explanation**: Core ideas explained in beginner-friendly language with real-world analogies
- **Practical Example**: Real-world scenario demonstrating the concept in action
- **Summary**: Key takeaways, terms review, and chapter connections

This textbook uses a **concise, concept-first approach** focused on conceptual understanding rather than hands-on labs. This makes it accessible without infrastructure requirements (no ROS 2 installation, no simulation environment setup).

Start with Module 1 and progress sequentially through the modules.
